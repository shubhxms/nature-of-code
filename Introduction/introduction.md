# introduction

- a quick overview of basic stuff


### walker

* a walker object can perform 9 unique movements in a plane(2d)

    * up, down, left, right, top-left, top-rigth, bottom-left, bottom-right and nothing



### random numbers

- psuedo random numbers generated are uniform in distribution over large samples

- while modelling nature, uniform distribution does not always make sense
     
     - consider evolution

- there are multiple ways in which we can use random function with probability



### random func and prob

- choosing random vals from array with repeated vals

- allow something to happen if a random num is above/below a threshold

    - can be applied to multiple outcomes; eg do x if num b/w 0 and 0.3, y if num b/w 0.3 and 0.8 and z otherwise



### normal distribution

- a distribution of values clustering around the mean/average

- common in nature

- gives the "bell curve" when graphed
